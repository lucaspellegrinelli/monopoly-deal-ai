# Monopoly Deal AI

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION
This is not completed/usable/stable in any shape or form. There is a lot to do both on the AI and on the actual game simulation in terms of optimizations and even mechanics not working properly/not implemented.

## The Game
You can read the rules, check out the cards and everything in http://monopolydealrules.com/

## The Ideia
Creating an artificial intelligence to play it!

### How I'm thinking about doing it
...

## Can I try it?
Yes! You can download the project and create a bot using the random action bot I created for testing ([random_bot.py](https://github.com/lucaspellegrinelli/monopoly-deal-ai/blob/master/monopoly/bots/random_ai.py)) to get an ideia of how things work and how you can add your logic in there. To test it you can go to [main.py](https://github.com/lucaspellegrinelli/monopoly-deal-ai/blob/master/main.py) and change the code to import your bot instead of RandomAI.
